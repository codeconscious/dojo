# The Dojo

A very small workshop where I try out various languages and technologies. Keep in mind that this is just a scratchpad, so nothing is polished!

| Language |  Notes |
|---|---|
| Bash scripting | Definitely need to pick up more of this. |
| Crystal | Basically Ruby with strong types! |
| F#  |  Since I'm familiar with C# and .NET, and I'm interested in functional programming, this one seems like a natural match. I haven't dug in deeply yet, though. |
| GraphQL  | Picked up for work. |
| Haskell  | Another small foray into functional programming. |
| Python  | I intend to look at it more sometime. |
| Ruby  | Picked up for work. |
| Rust  | Strong favorite! I hope to work with Rust more in the future. |
| Typescript  | JavaScript with strong types! |
