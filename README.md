# The Dojo

A very small workshop where I try out various languages, etc.

| Language |  Notes |
|---|---|
| F#  |  Since I'm familiar with C# and .NET, and I'm interested in functional programming, this one seems like a natural match. I haven't dug deeply yet, though. |
| GraphQL  | Picked up for work (and mostly use at work.) |
| Haskell  | Another small foray into functional programming. |
| Python  | I intend to look at it more sometime. |
| Ruby  | Picked up for work (and mostly use at work.) |
| **Rust**  | Strong favorite. I hope to work with Rust more in the future. |
| Typescript  | JavaScript with strong types sounds like an improvement to me!. |
