# The Dojo

A very small workshop where I try out various languages and technologies. Keep in mind that this is just a scratchpad, so nothing is polished!

| Language |  Notes |
|---|---|
| Bash scripting | Definitely need to pick up more of this. |
| Crystal | Basically Ruby, but with strong types and compile-time checks |
| F#  |  Since I'm familiar with C# and .NET, and I'm interested in functional programming, this one seems like a natural match. I haven't dug in deeply yet, though. |
| Go | Need to look more into this one. |
| GraphQL  | Picked up for work. Pretty interesting. |
| Haskell  | Another small foray into functional programming. |
| Kotlin   | Haven't dug in much, but it seems pretty nice. |
| Python   | I should look more into it since it's so ubiquitous these days. |
| Ruby     | Picked up for work. |
| Rust     | Strong favorite! I hope to use Rust more in the future. |
| Typescript  | JavaScript with strong types! |
