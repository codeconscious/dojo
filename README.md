# The Dojo

A very small workshop where I try out various languages and technologies. Keep in mind that this is just for practice and experimentation, so there's nothing much to see...

| Language |  Notes |
|---|---|
| Bash scripting | Definitely need to pick up more of this. |
| Crystal | Basically Ruby, but with strong types and compile-time checks. Haven't touched in some time. |
| **F#**  |  Since I was familiar with C# and .NET and was already curious about functional programming, this one seems like a natural match. F# is great, and picking it and FP up (though I"m still learning both!) rather relit my passion for programming as a whole. |
| Go | Tried it out a bit, but it didn't really stick. |
| GraphQL  | Picked up for work. Pretty interesting. |
| **Haskell**  | After F#, I started wondering about the purer FP experience Haskell offers. I've just started, but my first impressions are positive. |
| Kotlin   | Haven't dug in much, but it seems pretty nice. |
| Python   | I should probably look more into it since it's so ubiquitous these days. |
| Ruby     | Picked up since I use Rails at work. It's honestly a pretty nice language, despite its dynamic nature. |
| Rust     | I was really into Rust for a while, though I haven't touched it in some time. |
| Typescript  | I'm curious about this one, as I hear its type system is quite good, and it might be decent for FP too. |
